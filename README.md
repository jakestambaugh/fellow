A programming language designed for coding interviews

## Why

Why make a programming language: I want to make a programming language to teach myself how to make one! I think that's a pretty good reason in its own right.

The more interesting "why" might be "Why focus on technical interviews": I want to make a programming language by starting with a unique set of constraints and values. I think that programming languages can only succeed and fail when compared to their own stated values. Many programming languages state that they target professional programmers and are designed for production software. Many programming languages state which layer of the stack they are intending to be powerful with. Technical interviews are a new environment and let me explore new constraints.

### Technical Interviews are bad 

I agree! The standard FAANG "whiteboard" interview and its like are not a great measure of programming ability. I think that they are most able to measure stress.

I specifically wanted to make a programming language for technical interviews because it's a specific and constrained enviroment for programming. I think it's interesting to explore what a programming language looks like with different constraints to the many "general-purpose" languages in the ecosystem.
