* No module system

* No multi-file support

* No build system

* Test framework integrated into the file like Rust

* Whitespace sensitive? Easier to write down when programming forward

* Std collections library with easy runtime understanding

* Easy record and tuple types with destructuring

* No tail recursion (stack overflow is a useful signal)

* Static typing

* Pointers (or something to let people show off ptr math / 2 ptr windowing)
